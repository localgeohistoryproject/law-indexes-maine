    "description": "<p>As part of efforts to expand the Local Geohistory Project, which aims to educate users and disseminate information concerning the geographic history and structure of political subdivisions and local government, this repository has been created to disseminate law index data for the State of Maine. This index currently covers private and special laws only from 1820 through 1957.</p><p>Private and special laws concern one or several individuals, entities, or localities, unlike public or general laws, which apply to all similarly situated individuals, entities, and localities within a jurisdiction. Throughout New England, private and special laws were often the primary method used to alter municipal and county boundaries and forms of government.</p><p>The law index is released as a tab-separated values (TSV) file, <strong>output/MeLawIndex.tsv</strong>. The Detail column may contain additional Prefix information that is repeated from prior entries.</p><p>This repository does not contain the full text of the laws, nor does it currently contain links to the full text. Because the index was created using OCR technology, it may contain uncaptured errors.</p>",
